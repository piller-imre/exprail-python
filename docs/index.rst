Exprail - Expression Rail Library Documentation
===============================================

The *Exprail* is a modeling method and the set of software utils for helping the design and implement of

* grammars by syntax diagrams (also called *railroad* diagrams),
* behaviors and application logics by state diagrams or decision trees.

In fact, the library is a special kind of parser generators which interprets directly the state transition graph.
There are various advantages of this approach.

* The visual representation is more convenient than the textual one in most cases.
* It makes easier to provide more sophisticated and verbose error handling.
* It uses a simple, programming language independent graph description format.
